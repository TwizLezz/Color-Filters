Conway's Game is life game
the code i have written consists of functions that make this game possible first function is to create a bitmap to visualize and create a grid with pixels CreateGridSurface() then i have the button reset which it lets you choose how big or small you want the grid to be and then reset the bitmap to that size .The advance button as well as the go buttton call the GetNextState function which applys the conditions on the created grid the advance button helps you view the updates on every frame and by pressing the go button it will start a loop you can stop the loop as soon as the go button changes . The conditions i have are for a cell to be born it needs 3 neighbors and to stay alive 2 or 3 a pixel dies when its lonely or when its crowded, you can easily change the coniditions in the GetNextState function
